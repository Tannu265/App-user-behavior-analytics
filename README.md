# User Behavior Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing user behavior data to understand how users interact with an application. Using Python and data analysis techniques, the project explores engagement patterns, activity trends, and user interactions through data cleaning and visualization.

The goal is to transform raw user interaction data into meaningful insights that can help improve user experience and decision-making.
